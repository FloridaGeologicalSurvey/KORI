The Falmouth 2 dimensional acoustic flow meters (2D-ACM) utilized by the FGS in the deep sensor network are manufactured by [Falmouth Scientific, Inc.](http://www.falmouth.com/) of Cataumet, Massachusetts. They were installed in the conduit network by the volunteers of the [Woodville Karst Plain Project (WKPP)](https://www.globalunderwaterexplorers.org/Projects/WKPP).

These meters use high-precision acoustic sensors to measure phase shift transit time in order to determine flow velocity and direction. The 2D-ACM meters used by the FGS are outfitted with FSI's optional CTD package, giving them the capability to measure water conductivity, temperature, and pressure. They also record approximately 25 component vectors used to calculate the flow direction, velocity, and sensor tilt.

The 2D-ACM are located in extremely remote and inaccessible locations that require the technical expertise of the WKPP divers in order to install and maintain. Access to these locations is controlled by the prevailing water conditions in the conduits and the availability of divers, and during some periods meters have gone as long as 3 years between service. 

FSI has called the difficulty of access and length of deployment of the deep network sensors "unprecedented" (Kincaid 2008, 57), and considers any deployment longer than a year as a "long deployment" after which the factory calibration of the sensor is not guaranteed. FGS staff is currently working to provide calibration and deployment information in the [WKP-HRDB](https://github.com/FloridaGeologicalSurvey/KORI/wiki/Woodville-Karst-Plain-Hydrologic-Research-Database)

More details about sensor operations and specifications can be found in the [Falmouth 2D-ACM User Manual](http://www.falmouth.com/Manuals/2DACM/2DACM%20manual%20(lo%20res).pdf), including a list of the parameters recorded by each sensor (p6-6)
