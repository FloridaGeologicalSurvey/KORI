The Deep Sensor Network consists of 9 [Falmouth 2D-ACM sensors](https://github.com/FloridaGeologicalSurvey/KORI/wiki/Falmouth-2D-ACM) installed with the volunteer assistance of the [Woodville Karst Plain Project divers](https://www.globalunderwaterexplorers.org/Projects/WKPP). These sensors are located approximately 190'-280' below land surface in the [karst conduits](https://github.com/FloridaGeologicalSurvey/KORI/wiki/Karst-Conduits) that connect to [Wakulla Spring](https://github.com/FloridaGeologicalSurvey/KORI/wiki/Wakulla-Spring).

Geographically, the deep sensors are divided into two groups: the northern group and the southern group. The northern group sensors are located the major karst conduits that feed into the main vent of Wakulla springs: A, B, C, D, and K conduits.

The southern group consists of three sensors: one at Revell sink, a karst window located on private land; and two in vents in the [Spring Creek spring complex](https://github.com/FloridaGeologicalSurvey/KORI/wiki/Spring-Creek).
