_Site Characterization_:  
The C tunnel sensor sits approximately 100 yards upstream of the intersection of B and C tunnel, approximately 730 ft. south-southeast of the main Wakulla vent. The C conduit runs south-southeast from the B-C intersection and then turns southwest. This conduit is one of the lesser explored conduits.
  
C, like B conduit, is dominated by groundwater flow, and shows little sensitivity to recharge events. The predominant direction of flow at this sensor is to the northwest, with a minimum flow velocity of 0.073 cm/s, a mean flow velocity of 2.223 cm/s, and a max flow velocity of 7.534 cm/s for all measurements. Both conductivity and temperature are relatively invariant: the minimum temperature is 20.36째 C while the maximum is 20.66째 C; the minimum conductivity is 0.2830 mmho/cm and the maximum conductivity is 0.4250 mmho/cm.

Note there is a presumed bad conductivity value recorded by this sensor at 2012-02-09 19:21:19 UTC that does not agree with any other data collected by this sensor. The pressure readings at this sensor also show a steady decline even during the calibration period that is similar to that of a failing pressure transducer (cf. B conduit pressure data).
