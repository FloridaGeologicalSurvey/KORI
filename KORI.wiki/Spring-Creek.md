From [Florida Geological Survey Special Publication No. 47 (Lane 2001, 1)]
(http://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/FGS/FGS_Publications/SP/SP47LaneSpringCreek.pdf):
> The Spring Creek Springs Group is comprised of at least 13 submarine springs situated in the mouth of
> Spring Creek and adjacent Stuart Cove, along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Wakulla County, Florida.
> Combined flow of the group is about 2,000 cubic feet per second. The springs are fed by conduits, likely
> developed along fractures in the underlying carbonates. Analysis of local fracture trends suggests that
> one surface water source for the spring flow is Lost Creek, a stream captured by a sinkhole about six miles
> northwest of the springs. Regional groundwater of the Floridan aquifer system also supplies a portion of
> the total spring flow.
