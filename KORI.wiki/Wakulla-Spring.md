From [Florida Geological Survey Bulletin 66 (Scott et. al 2003)](http://www.dep.state.fl.us/geology/geologictopics/springs/bulletin66.htm):  
> Wakulla Spring is one of the largest and most dramatic of Florida’s springs.
> The spring pool is roughly circular with a diameter of 315 ft (96 m) north to south. The maximum
> pool depth is 185 ft (56.4 m). The vent opening is a horizontal ellipse along the south
> side of the pool bottom and is estimated to measure 50 ft by 82 ft (15.2 m by 25 m). Along
> with a few smaller springs nearby, including Sally Ward Spring, Wakulla Spring gives rise
> to the clear Wakulla River. Water clarity of the spring in October 2001 was exceptional and
> the water was light blue. It should be noted that the water clarity of the spring varies dramatically
> in response to rainfall. Surface water entering the sinkholes that connect to the
> Wakulla Spring system greatly reduces the clarity. Exotic aquatic vegetation once covered
> much of the spring pool and adjacent river bottom, but divers have recently removed large
> amounts and herbicides have been used in efforts to control it. The Wakulla River remains
> choked with exotic invasive plants. Many other aquatic and emergent plant species also are
> present in the spring pool and river. A mixed hardwood, cabbage palm, and cypress forest
> inhabits lowlands along the north and east shores of the spring and along the river.
> Uplands along the western shore of the spring are developed into a state park lodge and
> facilities. Also, there are hardwoods and large loblolly pines scattered about. A major underwater
> cave system has been mapped at Wakulla Springs.
