_Site Characterization_:  
The AD tunnel sensor sits in the A tunnel about 100 yards upstream of the intersection of A and D tunnels; this location is approximately 1,200 ft. southwest of the main Wakulla vent. The A conduit runs south from the A-D intersection. This conduit is one of the better explored conduits and leads the the Q-terminus, which is the southern limit of exploration. 
  
This conduit shows a strong response to recharge events. The predominant direction of flow at this sensor is to the northwest, with a minimum flow velocity of 0.019 cm/s, a mean flow velocity of 6.921 cm/s, and a max flow velocity of 37.935 cm/s for all measurements. Conductivity is relatively invariant, with a minimum reading of 0.1850 mmho/cm and a maximum reading of 1.0480 mmho/cm. The temperature of the water in the conduit shows a strong response to recharge events, with a minimum temperature of 18.54째 C and a maximum of 22.20째 C; additionally, a clear seasonal pattern can be seen in the temperature data from this sensor.

The pressure readings at this sensor also shows a steady decline after 2008 as the pressure transducer began to fail, a pattern that is typical in the deep network sensors that go long periods without servicing.
