Readme for the FGS Karst Open Research Initiative  

Updated 2015-08-24 - Message from Seth (repo maintainer and data guy)
The current copy of the database on the FTP is my _dev version that includes a fair amount of the insitu surface sensor data. As of 2015-06-24, the insitu and insitu_wle tables should be treated with a high degree of caution: I'm only about halfway through loading the insitu data and have not had a chance to check the values in the database against the values in the raw files. The calculated WLE's use the average daily barometric pressure from the Tallahassee airport; I'm still waiting on Scott to cross check these values.

I hope to have the insitu data loaded and verified and the WLE data calculated out and the accompanying documentation generated by December. Work has been busy and I have a bunch of other projects clamoring for my attention (including some other parts of this one) that have made it hard to find the time necessary to complete the insitu loads.

At this point in the process, you should treat any values you see in the database with suspicion - see, for example, the problem with some of the B conduit data (latest issue on the issues page). 

Quality flags are coming by early 2016 so that sorting out the good from the bad is a bit easier. During the same time, I will also be looking at the viability of transitioning all of the data in the database into a standard data model so that queries are also easier to write.
